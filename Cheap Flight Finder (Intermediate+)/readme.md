The **Cheap Flight Finder** app uses pre-determined data in google sheets to look for cheap flight deals in the next 6 months and notifies the users registered in the 'users' sheet via email.

The IATA Column can be found by running the main.py script and can be left empty. The City column lists the cities being travelled to and the lowest price column lists the respective ticket price cutoffs.

add_user.py is a standalone script that can be used to add new users to the 'users' sheet.
